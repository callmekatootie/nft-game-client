# NFT Game Client

### **Welcome ðŸ‘‹**
To get started with this course, clone this repo and follow these commands:

1. Run `npm install` at the root of your directory
2. Run `npm run start` to start the project
3. Start coding!

Created as part of the [buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) course - Build your own turn-based game on the blockchain using L2 networks.

### Details

We have the following components:

- If a user has not connected their Metamask wallet, they see the Connect To Wallet view

- If a user has connected their Metamask wallet, but has not minted any new character NFT, they see the Select a Character view

- If a user has connected their Metamask wallet and has also minted a character NFT they will be playing with, they see the Arena component, where they can battle it out with the Boss

They battle with THE BOSS - Dormamu and attempt to bring it down. Collectively this is possible. Individually, it would be futile, since Dormamu has very high HP

**NOTE**

- This is just the client. You will find the server / blockchain code that it interacts with in [this repository](https://github.com/callmekatootie/nft-game)
- The NFT that I received for completing this course is located [here](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x3CD266509D127d0Eac42f4474F57D0526804b44e/3266?force_update=true)
